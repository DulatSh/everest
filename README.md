### Portfolio: Data Analyst

#### About Me Hello! My name is Dulat, and I am a entry-level data analytics professional recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and SkyPro Certificate. 

In this repository, you can find some of my projects completed during my training and practice.

#### Projects Project 1: Online Cinema Unit Economics Calculator 
Tasks: 

Task 1. Determine what constitutes a unit in the economy of this project.   
Task 2. Calculate the unit economics of the product and propose a scenario for configuring parameters to achieve a 25% profit margin.     
Task 3. Select the optimal method for calculating retention.   
Task 4. Create visualizations of key business metrics.   
Task 5. Analyze user data and their behavior.  

Approach: The following indicators were calculated: Retention, LT (Lifetime), LTR (Lifetime Revenue), CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CAC per unit, Share of CAC and Cost, and Marginality.

Conclusions.
The following was analyzed:   
How films are distributed in terms of popularity. 
How many of the most popular films are needed to cover half of all views. 
How activity is distributed throughout the day. And throughout the week. Is there a difference in activity between weekends and weekdays. 
How users are distributed across time zones.

#### Project 2: Modeling Changes in Student Balances
Tasks:   
Task 1. The main task is to model the changes in students' balances.   
Task 2. Determine the total number of lessons that were on the balance of all students for each calendar day.   
Task 3. Track how this number changed due to transactions (payments, credits, corrective deductions) and lessons (deductions from the balance as lessons are completed).   
Task 4. Create a table that shows the balances of each student for each day.  

Approach: We used SQL to create several CTE queries that allowed us to calculate the cumulative sums of the number of lessons completed. To do this, we utilized table joins and window functions to find the cumulative sum based on the necessary fields and performed sorting. We also created a visualization of the final result.

Conclusions.
This project allowed me to develop analytical skills such as:   
The ability to write queries without logical and syntactical errors.
The ability to identify problems in data and discuss them.
The ability to write code that produces the correct result in the format requested by the client.
The ability to write readable code that can be easily understood by colleagues.
